<h1>Prism-JS for DITA-OT</h1>

A code highlighting DITA-OT Plug-in which integrates the flexible [PrismJS](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism) highlighting library into the DITA Open Toolkit engine. This enables the generation of documents including code snippets which are automatically colorized according to language syntax. The plug-in extends both static HTML and PDF transtypes.

What is PrismJS?
----------------

Prism is a lightweight, robust, elegant syntax highlighting library. It's a spin-off project from [Dabblet](http://dabblet.com/).

- Highlights embedded languages (e.g. CSS inside HTML, JavaScript inside HTML)
- Highlights inline code (`<codeph>`) as well, not just code blocks (`<codeblock>`)
- Highlights nested languages (CSS in HTML, JavaScript in HTML)
- It doesnâ€™t force you to use any Prism-specific markup
